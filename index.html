    <h2>What is a Hurricane?</h2>
    <p>A hurricane is a powerful tropical storm that forms over warm ocean waters, typically near the equator. These storms have intense winds, heavy rains, and a calm center called the eye. Hurricanes are categorized by their wind speed from Category 1 to Category 5, with higher categories representing more severe storms. Along with strong winds, hurricanes can cause dangerous storm surges, where seawater is pushed onto land, resulting in severe flooding..</p>

    <h2>How does a hurricane form?</h2>
    <p>Hurricanes develop from warm, moist air rising from the ocean, which creates low pressure. As this air cools, it forms clouds and releases heat, fueling further air to rise. The Earth’s rotation causes the system to spin, creating the hurricane’s characteristic shape. For a hurricane to grow, it needs:

Warm Water: Sea temperatures of at least 26.5°C (80°F).
High Humidity: To maintain storm strength.
Low Wind Shear: To allow the storm structure to stay intact.</p>

    <h2>Impact of hurricanes</h2>
    <p>Hurricanes can cause:

Strong Winds: Damaging buildings and infrastructure.
Heavy Rainfall: Leading to flash flooding and landslides.
Storm Surges: Flooding coastal areas with seawater.
Economic and Environmental Damage: High costs and long-term impacts on ecosystems..</p>

    <h2>Tips for Staying Prepared</h2>
    <p>To stay safe during hurricane season:

Stay Informed: Monitor weather updates.
Prepare an Emergency Kit: Include water, food, medications, and important documents.
Have an Evacuation Plan: Know local routes and shelters.
Protect Your Home: Secure windows and clear gutters.
Follow Authorities' Instructions: Always heed warnings and evacuation orders for your safety.
